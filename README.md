Hi everyone,

I'm a health economist working with hospital data from all over the province of Quebec, Canada.
I mainly use R and Python as my primary statistical tools.
I also often use SQL to access all those tasty data frames from SQL Server.

* I'm interested in learning more about machine learning implementation in the healthcare system
