Hi everyone,

I'm a health economist working with hospital data from all over the province of Quebec, Canada.
I mainly use R as my primary statistical tool but I tend to switch to Python when necessary.
I also use SQL a lot to access all those tasty data frames from SQL Server.

* I'm interested in learning more about machine learning implementation in the healthcare system
* I'm currently looking for a new job overseas, more specifically in the Netherlands where I'm moving in July.
